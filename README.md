# Paws-To-Home

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to help people who are interested in adopting a cat or a dog. The Paws-To-Home site allows people to search for either a cat and/or dog by location and age. API call return search results depending on which search functions our end user selects (type/zip/age). The webpage will also allow users to save an email they are interested in into a favorites list on a separate html page - these saved favorites are saved into local storage.
